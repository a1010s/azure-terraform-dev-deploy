# Azure Terraform Deployment
- This repo will deploy some of the free tier resources for DevOps testing purposes.
- Will keep the costs to a minimum if there is no free tier resource - like AKS K8s Cluster.
- To only deploy selected resources: comment the module code from the main.tf file
`NOTE: Work in Progress. Need to better organize and add all Terraform Modules`
